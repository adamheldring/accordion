      <div class="title" id="section1"><div class="glass-box"></div><p class="question">How do I start home brewing?</p></div>
      <div class="description" id="description1">
        <p>Your local home brew/home wine making retailer is the best source of information, equipment and ingredients for your first few batches. Generally, they will have at least a basic starter package that will ease you in to the process, and will be there with advice and answers, to help insure good results the first, and hopefully, every time. </p>

      <div class="title" id="section2"><div class="glass-box"></div><p class="question">What does it cost to brew my own beer?</p></div>
      <div class="description" id="description2">
        <p>Your initial investment may be $90-$100 for a starter package with equipment and ingredients for your first batch. This will yield about two cases of premium beer. So if you only brew once, you will have paid about $50 per case of beer. However, your second batch, depending on the style or recipe you choose, may cost as little as $20 to $35. Do the math- at $25 per batch, you have paid $12.50 per case, for something equivalent to (usually better than) a commercial beer costing twice as much. Your equipment kit can pay for itself in two or three batches. There is no price you can put on the satisfaction of having made a beer better than you could buy. And the expressions of disbelief and joy on your friends faces when they first try the best beer they have ever had? Priceless…</p>

      <div class="title" id="section3"><div class="glass-box"></div><p class="question">What is malt and what does it do?</p></div>
      <div class="description" id="description3">
        <p>Malt, or malted barley, provides the fermentable sugars, flavor, body and color components for your beer. Some brewers prefer to start from the malted barley grain (“all grain brewers”), while others prefer to save time and buy a commercially prepared malt extract, either as a thick syrup or in a dried powder form. This malt is used as the basis for any given recipe – think of it as making bread – the malt is the flour for our liquid bread.</p>

      <div class="title" id="section4"><div class="glass-box"></div><p class="question">What are hops and what do they do?</p></div>
      <div class="description" id="description4">
        <p>Hops are perennial vines. It is the flowers, or cones (they look like little green pine cones) that are used in the brewing process. Hops do many things for your beer. They provide bitterness to balance the sweetness of the malt. They provide flavor and aroma, some head retention qualities, and act as a preservative for your beer. There are many varieties of hops which have been bred and developed for various qualities. Some are very bitter, so the brewer does not need as much to provide a certain level of balance. Some are renowned for their particular flavor or aromatic quality. Think of hops as the spices used in cooking your beer. The most common form that home brewers use are pelletized – chopped up and compressed into small pellets – making them easier to store and measure. Whole leaf hops are also used, but take up much more space, and tend to oxidize faster.</p>
